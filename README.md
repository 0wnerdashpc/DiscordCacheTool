# DiscordCacheTool
Python script that grabs your cache, turns them into png's and allows cached photos to be viewed.

The script, makes a directory on your desktop called DiscordImgs

Copies your discord cache, to the directory on your desktop.

Then converts the files to a .png to be viewed.

Not all files in cache will become a working image.

This tool is made so people can check their cache for deleted images, or possible illegal content that remained from a raid

or another malicious attack on a server, and possibly remove it from their computer.
